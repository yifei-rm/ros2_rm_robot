## rm_control_Package_Description
rm_control is a function package for realizing the moveit2 control of a real robotic arm. The package is mainly used to further subdivide the path points planned by moveit2, and give the subdivided path points to rm_driver in a through-transmission way to realize the planning and running of the robotic arm. This package is introduced in detail in the following aspects.
* 1.Package use.
* 2.Package architecture description.
* 3.Package topic description.
Through the introduction of the three parts, it can help you:
* 1.Understand the package use.
* 2.Familiar with the file structure and function of the package.
* 3.Familiar with the topic related to the package for easy development and use.

## rm_control_Package_Function
### Basic_use_of_the_package
The unified entry point is recommended:
```bash
ros2 launch rm_control rm_control.launch.py arm_type:=65
```

Unified launch arguments:

- `arm_type` (required): `63`, `63_iii`, `65`, `75`, `eco62`, `eco63`, `eco65`, `gen72`, `gen72_ii`, or `rx75`.
- `follow` (default: `auto`): accepts only `auto`, `true`, or `false`; `auto` preserves the model's existing default following mode.

Selecting `rx75` creates both the `left_arm` and `right_arm` control nodes. The eight legacy model entry points (`63`, `65`, `75`, `eco62`, `eco63`, `eco65`, `gen72`, and `rx75`) are now compatibility wrappers, and their existing commands remain supported.

First, after configuring the environment and completing the connection, we can directly start the node and run the rm_control package.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch  rm_control rm_<arm_type>_control.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, eco63, eco62, 75, gen72, and rx75.  
For example, the launch command of 65 robotic arm:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch  rm_control rm_65_control.launch.py
```
The following screen appears in the interface after successful node startup.

It does not play a role when the node of the package is launched alone. It needs to be combined with the rm_driver package and the relevant nodes of moveit2 to play a role. For details, please refer to the relevant content of "rm_moveit2_config Detailed Description".
### Advanced_use_of_the_package
The following mode is configured directly through the unified launch entry; editing a launch file and rebuilding the workspace are not required:

```bash
ros2 launch rm_control rm_control.launch.py arm_type:=65 follow:=true
```

`follow:=true` selects high-follow mode, while `follow:=false` selects low-follow mode. High-follow mode tracks the transmitted trajectory more closely and requires suitable transmission rate, velocity, and acceleration settings. Low-follow mode has a lower usage threshold, but points that cannot be reached in time may be discarded. Use `follow:=auto` to preserve the selected model's historical default.

The user-facing `arm_type` value is the canonical model string listed in the basic-use section. The numeric values `65`, `651`, `634`, `632`, `621`, `75`, and `72` are internal node-parameter mappings maintained by the unified launch file; they are not values that users should pass to the `arm_type` launch argument.

The paths above show the root namespace used by single-arm models. For RX75, each control node applies its arm namespace: the corresponding interfaces are `/left_arm/rm_driver/move_stop_cmd`, `/left_arm/rm_driver/movej_canfd_cmd`, and `/left_arm/rm_group_controller/follow_joint_trajectory`, with equivalent `/right_arm/...` paths for the right arm.

We mainly focus on the following topics.
Publishers: represents its current published topic, the most important published topic is /rm_driver/movej_canfd_cmd, through which we publish the subdivided points to rm_driver node, and then rm_driver node gives the corresponding path to the robotic arm through the transmission way.
Action Servers: represents the action information it receives and publishes, `/rm_group_controller/follow_joint_trajectory` action as the bridge of communication between rm_control and moveit2, through which rm_control receives the path planned by moveit2, and rm_control further subdivides these paths from the above topic to rm_driver.
There are relatively few remaining topics and service use scenarios, so we do not introduce them in detail here, and you can learn by yourself.
