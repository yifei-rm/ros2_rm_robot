## rm_gazebo_Package_Description
rm_gazebo is mainly used for realizing the simulation function of robot arm Moveit2 planning. We build a virtual robotic arm in the simulation environment of Gazebo, and then control the virtual robot arm in Gazebo through Moveit2. This package is introduced in detail in the following aspects.
* 1.Package use.
* 2.Package architecture description.
Through the introduction of this part, it can help you:
* 1.Understand the package use.
* 2.Familiar with the file structure and function of the package.
Source code address: https://github.com/RealManRobot/ros2_rm_robot.git。
## rm_gazebo_Package_Running
### Control_of_the_simulation_robotic_arm
After the installation of the environment and the package, we can run the rm_gazebo package.

The unified entry is the recommended way to launch the Gazebo world and robot:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo rm_gazebo.launch.py arm_type:=65 arm_variant:=6fb
```
The unified entry accepts:

* `arm_type`: required; one of `63`, `63_iii`, `65`, `75`, `eco62`, `eco63`, `eco65`, `gen72`, `gen72_ii`, or `rx75`.
* `arm_variant`: end-link variant, default `standard`; the catalog contains supported combinations of `standard`, `6f`, `6fb`, and `6fb_v`.
* `start_gazebo`: default `true`. Set it to `false` only to reuse an already running Gazebo world named `empty`. This skips the Gazebo process itself, but robot spawning, the `/world/empty/clock` bridge, and controller spawning still run.
* `joint_states_topic`: only `auto` is currently supported. It resolves to `/joint_states` for normal arms and `/joint_state_broadcaster/joint_states` for RX75.
* `use_sim_time`: controls simulation time for `robot_state_publisher`, default `true`.

The catalog covers 10 robot models and 21 supported model/variant combinations. All 21 legacy `gazebo_*_demo.launch.py` entries remain available with their original arguments and defaults. For example:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_65_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the six-axis force version is currently available for 63, 65, 75, and eco65:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_<arm_type>_6f_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the integrated six-axis force version is currently available for 63, 63_III, 65, 75, eco63, eco65, and rx75:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_<arm_type>_6fb_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the vision-enabled integrated six-axis force version is currently only available for rx75:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_<arm_type>_6fb_v_demo.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models are 65, 63, 63_III, 75, eco62, eco63, eco65, gen72, gen72_II, and rx75. For RX75, use `gazebo_rx75_6fb_demo.launch.py` for RX75-6FB and `gazebo_rx75_6fb_v_demo.launch.py` for RX75-6FB-V. The interface displays as follows after successful running.

For the standard variants of 63, 65, 75, eco62, eco63, eco65, and gen72, use the following command to launch MoveIt 2:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_<arm_type>_config gazebo_moveit_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the six-axis force version is currently available for 63, 65, 75, and eco65:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_<arm_type>_config gazebo_moveit_demo_6f.launch.py
```
For the integrated six-axis force versions of 63, 65, 75, eco63, and eco65, use:
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_<arm_type>_config gazebo_moveit_demo_6fb.launch.py
```

RML63_III and GEN72_II reuse their base-model MoveIt packages, so do not substitute them into `rm_<arm_type>_config`. Use these exact commands:

```bash
ros2 launch rm_63_config gazebo_moveit_demo_III.launch.py
ros2 launch rm_63_config gazebo_moveit_demo_III_6fb.launch.py
ros2 launch rm_gen72_config gazebo_moveit_demo_II.launch.py
```

RX75 uses the dedicated MoveIt package `rm_rx75_config`: run `ros2 launch rm_rx75_config gazebo_moveit_demo_6fb_v.launch.py` for RX75-6FB-V and `ros2 launch rm_rx75_config gazebo_moveit_demo_6fb.launch.py` for RX75-6FB.
After the control interface of rviz2 pops up, you can perform the simulation control of moveit2 and Gazebo.
